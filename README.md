## My process

- Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity

## Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Implement a lightbox modal for the product images.
- Refine responsive design techniques for different device sizes.
- Experiment more with frameworks like React or Vue for similar projects.
- Use local storage to persist cart data.
